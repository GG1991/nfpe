The other day I was preparing a presentation and I wanted to show a FE mesh as an example. Obviouly to draw in a
graphical interface program was not an option so I decided to create a script 
<a href="https://github.com/GG1991/mesh2tikz" target="_blank">`mesh2tikz`</a>.

```bash
# elements.dat
0 1 3 2
4 5 7 6
1 3 6
1 4 6
```

```bash
# coordinates.dat
0.0,0.0
1.0,0.0
0.0,1.0
1.0,1.0
2.0,0.0
3.0,1.0
2.0,2.0
3.0,3.0
```

```bash
# colors.dat
1
2
1
2
```

```bash
./mesh2tikz elements.dat coordinates.dat colors.dat > ex1.tex
pdflatex ex1.tex
```
Finally we convert from `pdf` to `jpg` with `ImageMagic`:

```bash
convert -verbose  -density 150  -trim ex1.pdf  -quality 100 -flatten  -sharpen 0x1.0 ex1.jpg
```
